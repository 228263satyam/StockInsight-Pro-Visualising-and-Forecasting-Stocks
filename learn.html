                <h2>What is Stock?</h2>
                <p>
                    A stock represents a share in the ownership of a company and constitutes a claim on part of the company’s assets and earnings.
                    The more stock you own, the greater your ownership stake in the company. Stocks are also known as “equities.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Companies issue stock to raise money for a variety of reasons, including expanding or modernizing operations, financing
                    new ventures, or paying off debt.

                <p>
                    The stock market is where buyers and sellers meet to trade shares of publicly traded companies. It's essentially a marketplace
                    where individuals and institutions buy and sell ownership in businesses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the stock market, shares of stock are bought and sold, either through exchanges or over-the-counter markets. The stock market
                    is one of the most vital components of a free-market economy, as it provides companies with access to capital in exchange for
                    giving investors a slice of ownership.

                <h2 class="section-title zoom-in">How Does the Stock Market Work?</h2>
                <p>
                    The stock market works through a network of exchanges. Companies list shares of their stock on an exchange through a process
                    called an initial public offering (IPO). Investors purchase those shares, which allows the company to raise money to grow its business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Transactions happen when a buyer agrees to pay what the seller is asking, or when a seller accepts the buyer's bid. The stock market
                    functions like an auction, with buyers and sellers negotiating prices until a deal is agreed upon.

                <p>
                    Investing in stocks allows individuals to grow their wealth over time. Historically, stocks have provided higher returns compared
                    to other forms of investment, such as bonds or savings accounts. While stocks can be volatile in the short term, they tend to increase
                    in value over the long term, making them an essential component of any well-balanced portfolio.
